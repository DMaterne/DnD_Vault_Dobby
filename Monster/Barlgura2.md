*The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.*

*A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.*
