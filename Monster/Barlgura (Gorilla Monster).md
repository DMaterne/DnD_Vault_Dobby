| White Banana                | Magical banana with violet juice, alleviates exhaustion.                    | Removes 1 level of Exhaustion.                                     |
| Acidic Pineapple            | Fleshy rind with acidic spikes, dangerous raw but chemically interesting.   | Causes skin/clothing irritation, inedible without processing.      |
| Jungle Mango                | Sweet, juicy fruit. Completely ordinary, but delicious.                     | No magical effect, filling.                                        |

Upon their return to the city early in the morning, the exhausted [[Group]] sought shelter at the tavern "[[Der Freundliche Hänker]]" and later filed a report with [[Hauptmann Zoak]]. His interest in the brought fruits was evident, yet his behavior raised suspicion – as did the magical weapons in his office. While [[Echo]] restocked supplies and Castor Leo accompanied his family, [[Rhuk]] met secretly with a contact at "[[Zum Silbernen Anlitz]]", delivered evidence, and sent a report to their employer. The [[Group]] then reconvened at the tavern and was able to use two days for downtime.

During their reunion at the [[Der Freundliche Hänker|friendly Hänker]], the session ended, and the party had two days of downtime.

<b>Description:</b><br>
Dilos Feykar ("Deadly Forest") is a fortified, thriving frontier city located in the extreme south of the continent. Its walls span the entire length of the landbridge connecting it to the mysterious [[Public/Geographie/Städte/Dilos Feykar/Südöstliche Wälder|south-eastern woods]]. Anyone venturing into the wilderness must pass through Dilos Feykar.<br><br>

The city is a melting pot: Travelers, adventurers, researchers, refugees, merchants, fanatical believers, simple citizens, soldiers, and spies live side by side. Many come with grand plans – few return.<br><br>
The primary food source for the residents is fish. This is provided through a large number of fish caught.
